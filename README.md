### Description: This is the programming project for EECS 837 data mining course
- Utilizing LEM1 algorithm to find a set of possible rules and a set of certain rules for a dataset
- Using discretization to transform numerical values to unique strings

### Procedures to run the program
1. The simple command line interface will ask for the input file you want to operate the algorithm on
2. The user then will give the name of the two ouput files (name.possible.txt, name.certain.txt)
3. Finally type the following command to run the python script
```
python LEM1.py
```

### Test files
```
input files
│	austr.txt
│	bowl.txt
│	breast.txt
│	german.txt
│	iris.txt
│	test.txt
│	wine.txt
```
